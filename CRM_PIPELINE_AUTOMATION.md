# CRM Pipeline Automation

## Overview

The CRM Pipeline Automation feature provides a visual kanban-style board for managing deals and automating workflows when deals move through pipeline stages.

## Features

### Pipeline Board
- **Visual Organization**: Deals organized into 4 stages
  - Prospecting
  - Negotiation
  - Closed Won
  - Closed Lost
- **Drag & Drop**: Move deals between stages by dragging cards
- **Real-time Stats**: See deal counts and total value per stage
- **Pipeline Analytics**: 
  - Total deals count
  - Total pipeline value
  - Won deals count
  - Win rate percentage

### Deal Management
- Create new deals with title, value, and expected close date
- Track deal value in dollars
- Set expected close dates
- Link deals to contacts and leads
- Search and filter deals

### Automation Engine
When a deal moves to a new stage, the system:
1. Checks for active automations with "deal_stage_changed" trigger
2. Evaluates automation conditions (old_stage, new_stage)
3. Executes configured actions if conditions match

### Automation Types
Create custom automations in the Automations tab with:

**Trigger Events:**
- Contact Created
- Lead Created
- Lead Status Changed
- Deal Created
- Deal Stage Changed
- Form Submitted

**Action Types** (Coming Soon):
- Send Email
- Create Task
- Update Field
- Add Tag
- Trigger Webhook
