# 21st Equivalence Migration, then Expansion

## Objective (as I understand it)
1. Bring every section design and every registry entry up to 21st-equivalent standard (real 21st provenance, approved certification, portable recipe, `preferred` status).
2. Only after equivalence is proven, delete the generic/legacy designs and the legacy rendering path.
3. Then expand the design library, making full use of the 49 installed UI components recorded in `.21st/design.json`.

Yes, this is clear. I agree with the direction, with three corrections below.

## Where things actually stand
- 92 registered section designs. 36 carry 21st provenance, 31 are certified approved, 35 are marked `preferred`.
- So roughly 56 designs are still generic/legacy and cannot be generated into sites today.
- A second, older rendering path still exists: 15 hand-written section components (`src/sections/components/*`) wired through `src/sections/registry.ts`, separate from the variant registry.
- `.21st/design.json` lists design tokens plus `src/components/ui` (50 files). It is a manifest of UI primitives and tokens — it is not a library of finished 21st blocks.

## My objections / corrections
1. **Do not delete legacy before coverage is proven per family and per visual direction.** Every one of the 14 visual directions must resolve a certified design for every section family it declares. We hit exactly this failure recently ("no certified implementation for logo-cloud"). Removal must be gated by a passing coverage test, not by a date.
2. **"21st equivalence" cannot mean fabricating provenance.** With your paid yearly 21st.dev plan there is no retrieval limit, so the default for all ~56 generic designs is a genuine 21st source adaptation with real source id, author, and licence recorded. Owner-authorised adaptation stays the exception, used only where no suitable 21st source exists, and each one is recorded as such.
3. **Expansion from `design.json` is composition, not installation.** The 50 primitives already pinned and wired become the building blocks for new certified section designs; they do not themselves become section designs.

## Plan

### Phase A — Equivalence audit (no deletions)
- Emit a per-design ledger: origin, certification, portable recipe, generation status, pack usage, and the reason each design is not yet generation-eligible.
- Emit a coverage matrix: 14 visual directions x every section family, marking which families survive if legacy is removed today.
- Fail CI on any regression in that matrix.

### Phase B — Migrate to equivalence, family by family
Work families in dependency order (navbar, hero, footer first — they are compiler-owned chrome), then content families. Per design: normalise tokens, stamp canonical identity/slots/intents, add interaction and reduced-motion states, certify the portable recipe, register provenance, promote to `preferred`.

### Phase C — Retire legacy
Only families that are green in the Phase A matrix, at every visual direction:
- Remove the superseded generic variants from the variant registry.
- Collapse the older `src/sections/components/*` path into the variant registry so there is one design authority.
- Keep registry-derived Wizard pickers, art-direction packs, and coverage tests passing at each step.

### Phase D — Expansion
- Author new certified designs composed from the installed primitives, targeting the families with the thinnest choice.
- Spend the daily 21st pulls on genuine sources for the families where authored adaptation is weakest.
- Every new design registers automatically through the existing registry pipeline; no new registries.

## Technical notes
Authorities stay unchanged: Variant Registry, DesignImplementationRegistry, Art Direction Packs, Artifact Registry, Wizard Registry Context. No new registries are introduced; pickers, coverage, and AI context remain projections over those owners. Deletions land behind the coverage gate, and each phase ends with the full suite, typecheck, and preview build green.

## Question before I start
Phase A is read-only and safe. Confirm you want me to start there, and confirm that for designs with no obtainable 21st source I should register them as owner-authorised adaptations rather than retiring them.
