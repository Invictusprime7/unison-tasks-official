/**
 * Vertical Launch Contract
 * ─────────────────────────
 * Single typed source-of-truth for what each business vertical (booking, saas,
 * agency, portfolio, store, content) guarantees at launch time. Replaces the
 * ad-hoc `forceSalonPreviewReady` boolean that was scattered across
 * SystemLauncher.tsx.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - SystemLauncher previously branched off a single bool for every per-vertical
 *   decision (booking on/off, lead capture on/off, selected-page scaffold,
 *   native-publish guarantee, etc). That conflated "is preselected?" with
 *   "what does this vertical promise?".
 * - The Readiness Center, deployment service, and downstream readiness manifest
 *   need a stable, typed contract they can inspect — not a magic boolean.
 *
 * This module is **pure** and has no side effects. It does NOT mutate readiness
 * — that remains owned by `nativePublishReadiness` + `deploymentService`.
